## HiC-Pro

This project is a Nextflow script allowing automation of analysis using HiC-Pro, a software used to analyse Hi-C sequence data, authored by Nicolas Servant.

This is based on a college assignment to develop a Nextflow script to analyse Hi-C data, using a Singularity image developed by Nicolas Servant. This project takes that one step further, attempting to recreate the original HiC-Pro repository including all necessary scripts and software that can be cloned and built from here.

A custom Singularity recipe and Dockerfile are included.
